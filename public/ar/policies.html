        <h3 id="policy-anchor-2">2. FOR WHAT PURPOSES WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
        <p>We process your personal data:</p>
        <h3>1. To provide our Service</h3>        
        <p>This includes enabling you to use the Service in a seamless manner and preventing or addressing Service errors or technical issues.</p>
        <p>To host personal data and enable our App to operate and be distributed we use <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>, which is a hosting and backend service provided by Amazon.</p>
        <p>To monitor infrastructure and the App’s performance, we use <strong>Crashlytics</strong>, which is a monitoring service provided by Google. Here’s its <a href="https://docs.fabric.io/apple/fabric/data-privacy.html#crashlytics" target="_blank">Data Collection Policy</a></p>
        <p>We use <strong>Firebase Performance Monitoring</strong> and <strong>Firebase Crash Reporting</strong>, which are monitoring services provided by Google. To learn more, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy policy</a> and <a herf="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy and Security in Firebase</a>.</p>
        <h3>2. To customize your experience</h3>
        <p>We process your personal data, in particular, such as your characteristics and preferences, to adjust the content of the Service and provide content tailored to your personal preferences. As a result of such processing, you get access, for example, to a nutrition plan containing only vegetarian products or a customized meal plan offer (in the in-App chat) tailored for achieving your goals.</p>
        <h3>3. To manage your account and provide you with customer support</h3>
        <p>We process your personal data to respond to your requests for technical support, Service information or to any other communication you initiate. This includes accessing your account to address technical support requests. For this purpose, we may send you, for example, notifications or emails about the performance of our Service, security, payment transactions, notices regarding our <a href="https://bttrm-v3.com/info/terms-eng.html" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> or this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3>4. To communicate with you regarding your use of our Service</h3>
        <p>We communicate with you, for example, by push notifications. These may include reminders and motivational messages encouraging you to follow your training and nutrition plan, or other information about the App. As a result, you may, for example, receive a push notification every day at a particular time reminding you to work out. To opt out of receiving push notifications, you need to change the settings on your device.</p>
        <p>The services that we use for these purposes may collect data concerning the date and time when the message was viewed by our App’s users, as well as when they interacted with it, such as by clicking on links included in the message.</p>
        <p><strong>Intercom</strong> provides us with message and customer service tools, which enable us to communicate with you within the App. When you chat with us via in-App chat, some of your information is automatically transferred to Intercom. The transfer is required to enable us to identify (if you shared any name related data with us) and to communicate with you in the in-App chat. Thus, Intercom uses these data to provide and fulfill its services (as set forth in their terms of service). Intercom is <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TNQvAAO&amp;status=Active" target="_blank">EU-US Privacy Shield certified</a>. Read more about Intercom’s approach to privacy in its <a href="https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>To communicate with you we also use <strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging</strong> and <strong>Firebase Notifications</strong>, which are message sending services provided by Google. Firebase Cloud Messaging allows us to send messages and notifications to users of our App across platforms such as Android and iOS. We integrate <strong>Firebase Notifications</strong> with <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to create analytics-based audiences and track opening and conversion events. As a result, we can, for example, send encouraging messages to users who have recently finished a training program. Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.</p>
        <p>We use <strong>Apple Push Notification</strong> service (“APNs”), that is a notifications service provided by Apple. APNs allows us to send information to iOS devices. Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.</p>
        <p>Zendesk</p>
        <h3>5. To research and analyze your use of the Service</h3>
        <p>This helps us to better understand our business, analyze our operations, maintain, improve, innovate, plan, design, and develop the Service and our new products. We also use data for statistical analysis purposes, to test and improve our offers. This enables us to better understand what features and training plans of the Services our users like more, what categories of users use our Services. As a consequence, we often decide how to improve the Service based on the results obtained from this processing. For example, if we discover that users more often engage in workouts designated for legs, we may develop and introduce a new workout for this area into the App.</p>
        <p>To perform research and analysis about how users interact with our App we use <strong>Appsflyer</strong>. Appsflyer enables us to understand, in particular, how users find us (for example, who was the advertiser that delivered an ad to users, which led you to an app store with our App). Appsflyer also provides us with different analytics tools that enable us to research and analyze your use of the Service. <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. Appsflyer allows you to <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/optout" target="_blank">Opt Out</a> of having data from my device sent to AppsFlyer's servers for apps usage collection.</p>
        <p>We use <strong>Facebook Analytics</strong>, which is a service is provided by Facebook that allows us to use different analytical tools. On Facebook Analytics we get, in particular, aggregated demographics and insights on how many people launch our app, how often users make purchases, and other interactions. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>We also use <strong>Amplitude</strong> that is an analytics service that we use to understand how customers use our Service. Amplitude collects various technical information, in particular, time zone, type of device (phone or tablet), unique identifiers (such as IDFA). Amplitude also allows us to track various interactions that occur in our App. As a result, Amplitude helps us to decide what features should we focus on (for example, if we see that most of the users focus on walking mediation workouts, we may develop more these). Amplitude is <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001XZAAY&amp;status=Active" target="_blank">EU-US Privacy Shield certified</a>. Amplitude provides more information on how they process data in its <a href="https://amplitude.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>To analyze how visitors use the Service and to measure the effectiveness of some ads we use <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, a web analysis program of Google. On Google Analytics we get, in particular, information on the data you enter on our website and users’ interactions within the website. Google allows you to influence the collection and processing of the information generated by Google, in particular, by installing a browser plug-in, available <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">here</a>. You can read more about how Google uses the information <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>To track and analyze behavior of our App’s users (in particular, how they react to changes of the App structure, text or any other component), we use <strong>Firebase Remote Config</strong>. Firebase Remote Config is an A/B testing and configuration service provided by Google, which also enables us to tailor the content that our App’s users see (for example, it allows us to show different onboarding screens to different users). <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy and Security in Firebase</a>.</p>
        <p>We also use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>, which is an analytics service provided by Google. In order to understand Google's use of data, consult Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">partner policy</a>. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy information</a>. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>To perform standard product analysis, we also use <strong>Fabric Answers</strong>, which is an analytics service provided by Crashlytics, a business division of Google. <a href="https://fabric.io/dpst.pdf" target="_blank">Data Processing and Security Terms</a>. <a href="https://docs.fabric.io/android/fabric/data-privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy information</a>.</p>
        <h3>6. To send you marketing communications</h3>
        <p>We process your personal data for our marketing campaigns. We may add your email address to our marketing list, provided we receive consent or otherwise establish legal basis for sending you marketing communications. As a result, you will receive information about our products, such as for example, special offers.
