        <p>6.4. By signing up for certain subscriptions, you agree that your subscription may be automatically renewed. Unless you cancel your subscription you authorize us and the App Stores to charge you for the renewal term. The period of auto-renewal will be the same as your initial subscription period unless otherwise disclosed to you on the Service. The renewal rate will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior subscription period, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless we notify you of a rate change prior to your auto-renewal.

We will not refund fees that may have accrued to your account and will not prorate fees for a cancelled subscription.</p>

It is ultimately your responsibility to know when the free trial will end. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to modify or terminate any free trial offer, your access to the Service during the free trial, or any of these terms without notice and with no liability. We reserve the right to limit your ability to take advantage of multiple free trials.</p>
        <p>6.6. The Service and your rights to use it expire at the end of the paid period of your subscription.

        <p>6.7. Subscriptions purchased via an App Store are subject to such App Store's refund policies. This means we cannot grant refunds. You will have to contact an App Store support.</p>
        <p>6.8. You agree that the Purchase is final, that Company will not refund any transaction once it has been made and that the Purchase cannot be canceled. When you make the Purchase, you acknowledge and agree that all Purchases are non-refundable or exchangeable. Since the Service is of a digital nature, we cannot accept any request for refunds and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost at this point. The Company may provide refunds at its own discretion and subject to our policies that may be published from time to time.</p>
        <p>6.9. We may post clear and conspicuous subscription terms from time to time on our websites and within the Apps.</p>

        <h3>12. MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>
        <p>Please read this arbitration provision carefully to understand your rights.</p>
        <p>(a) All claims must be resolved through binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator;</p>
        <p>(b) You are waiving the right to a trial by jury; the rights that you would have if you went to court, such as discovery or the right to appeal, may be more limited or may not exist;</p>
        <p>(c) You may only bring a claim in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff (lead or otherwise) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding;</p>
        <p>(d) The arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
        <p><strong>a. Mandatory Arbitration</strong></p>
        <p>This arbitration agreement provides that all disputes must be resolved through BINDING ARBITRATION whenever you or we choose to submit or refer a dispute to arbitration. You and the Company, and each of our respective agents, corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, agree to BINDING ARBITRATION (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court), as the exclusive form of dispute resolution except as provided for below, for all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Privacy Policy) or the Service, unless you are located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the exclusive use of arbitration for dispute resolution. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>
        <p><strong>b. Waiver of Class Action and Collective Relief</strong></p>
        <p>There shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated or litigated on a class action, joint or consolidated basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users of the Services, or any other persons. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that individual party’s claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. This waiver of class actions and collective relief is an essential part of this arbitration provision and cannot be severed from it.</p>
        <p><strong>c. Arbitration Procedures.</strong></p>
        <p>Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any questions regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION under the London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) Rules in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.</p>
        <p>- Overview. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the parties’ dispute. Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings. The following procedures (the “Arbitration Procedures”) are applicable to all arbitration proceedings involving you and us.</p>
        <p>- Administrator. The administrator for the arbitration is the LCIA, a non-profit organization that is not affiliated with us. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your dispute will be appointed by the LCIA in accordance with its rules. Information about the LCIA’s rules and fees can be found at: https://www.lcia.org//Dispute_Resolution_Services/lcia-arbitration-rules-2014.aspx.</p>
        <p>- Choice of Law. The governing law applicable to the arbitration agreement and the arbitration shall be the laws of England and Wales (also known as English Law), without regard to English Law’s conflict of laws rules.</p>
        <p>- Language. The language of the arbitration shall be English.</p>
        <p>- Applicable Rules. The arbitration will be governed by the LCIA’s Arbitration Rules (“LCIA Rules”), as modified by these Arbitration Procedures. If there is any inconsistency between the LCIA’s Rules and these Arbitration Procedures, the Arbitration Procedures will control. However, if the arbitrator determines that strict application of the Arbitration Procedures would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration, the arbitrator may make any order necessary to provide a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the LCIA Rules.</p>
        <p>- Commencing an Arbitration. To commence an arbitration against us, you must complete a written request for arbitration, submit it to the LCIA, and send a copy to us at email address indicate in Section 15. To learn more about commencing an arbitration and to obtain a form to institute arbitration, see the LCIA’s online filing page, https://onlinefiling.lcia.org/. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or have a lawyer (or some other representative) act on your behalf. Upon receipt of an arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims it may have against the complaining party.</p>
        <p>- Fees. You are responsible for paying your portion of the fees set forth in the LCIA’s Schedule of LCIA Arbitration Costs and as determined by the Arbitral Tribunal under LCIA Rules. We will pay all remaining fees. If your claim against us is for less than USD1,000, we will pay all fees. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys’ fees and additional costs. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, we will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law to pay.</p>
        <p>- Selection of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your dispute will be appointed by the LCIA in accordance with its rules.</p>
        <p>- Discovery. Each party may (a) request relevant, non-privileged documents from the other party; and (b) request that the other party provide the particulars of its claims or defenses. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other party within 10 days after the arbitrator’s appointment. The responding party shall provide the requesting party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, the requested particulars, and/or any objections to the requests within 15 days after receipt of the requests. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the arbitrator for prompt resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort what would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.</p>
        <p>- Communications with the Arbitrator. Whenever communicating with the arbitrator, the parties must include each other – for example, by including the other party on a telephone conference call and copying the other party on any written submissions, such as letters or emails. To the extent practicable, conferences with the arbitrator will take place by telephone conference call or email. Ex parte communications are not permitted with any arbitrator.</p>
        <p>- Confidentiality. Upon either party’s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted filing of confidential information must be done under seal.</p>
        <p>- Arbitration Award. The arbitrator will render a written decision within 14 days after the hearing or, if no hearing was held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award.</p>
        <p>- Waiver of Appeal. The parties waive any right to refer any question of law and any right of appeal on the law and/or the merits to any court.</p>
        <p>- Survivability. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms.</p>
        <h3>13. GOVERNING LAW</h3>
        <p>13.1. These Terms shall be governed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales (excluding its body of law governing conflicts of law).</p>
        <p>13.2. To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is for whatever reason not submitted to arbitration, each of the parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of England and Wales to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with this Terms and that accordingly proceedings must be brought in such courts.</p>
        <p>13.3. The parties irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts of England and waive any defenses of improper venue or forum non conveniens.</p>
        <h3>14. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</h3>
        <p>14.1. No delay or omission by us in exercising any of our rights occurring upon any noncompliance or default by you with respect to these Terms will impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver by the Company of any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof contained.</p>
        <p>14.2. Subject to Section 12, if any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then these Terms will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p>14.3. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, these Terms set forth the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding its subject matter, and supersede all prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.</p>
        <p>14.4. The Company may transfer or assign any and all of its rights and obligations under these Terms to any other person, by any way, including by novation, and by accepting these Terms you give the Company consent to any such assignment and transfer. You confirm that placing on the Service of a version of these Terms indicating another person as a party to the Terms shall constitute valid notice to you of the transfer of Company's rights and obligations under the Terms (unless otherwise is expressly indicated).</p>
        <p>14.5. All information communicated on the Service is considered an electronic communication. When you communicate with us through or on the Service or via other forms of electronic media, such as e-mail, you are communicating with us electronically. You agree that we may communicate electronically with you and that such communications, as well as notices, disclosures, agreements, and other communications that we provide to you electronically, are equivalent to communications in writing and shall have the same force and effect as if they were in writing and signed by the party sending the communication. You further acknowledge and agree that by clicking on a button labeled "SUBMIT", "CONTINUE", "REGISTER", "I AGREE" or similar links or buttons, you are submitting a legally binding electronic signature and are entering into a legally binding contract. You acknowledge that your electronic submissions constitute your agreement and intent to be bound by these Terms. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, CONTRACTS, ORDERS AND OTHER RECORDS AND TO ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF NOTICES, POLICIES AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED OR COMPLETED THROUGH THE SERVICE.</p>
        <p>14.6. In no event shall the Company be liable for any failure to comply with these Terms to the extent that such failure arises from factors outside the Company's reasonable control.</p>
